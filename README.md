# Aubay Cobol Academy 2023

 - This repository contains all the code and auxiliary files developed in the Cobol Academy organized by Aubay.

 - It was an amazing experience where I was introduced to and how to properly code in Cobol. Simultaneously, I also learned and worked with Structured Query Language (SQL), Job Control Language (JCL), the Sort statement, DB2 and CICS. And all the code and files produced can be seen here.

    And all this while experimenting on a completely new machine and operanting system, Mainframes and the IBM z/OS, respectively.

    Mainframes are powerful computing systems crucial for large-scale and critical business applications. They excel in processing extensive data, ensuring high reliability and security. Additionally, Mainframes serve as the backbone for organizations, providing stability, scalability, and seamless management of mission-critical operations, thus being used in banks, air companies, military applications and much, much more.
